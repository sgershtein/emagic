To install Encoding Magic ver 1.0 follow these steps:

1.  Rename either Makefile.DOS or Makefile.UNIX into Makefile (depending
on the OS you are going to compile it on).

2.  Edit Makefile.  In particular you might want to change compiler program
    name and options.

3.  If the encoding you want files to be converted to (you base encoding) is
    koi8-r, do nothing.  Otherwise convert at least frequen.cpp file into
    your base encoding.  For example, under DOS you will probably want to
    apply koi8->alt conversion to file frequen.cpp.  You can use any recoding
    software to do this, for example mpc or recode.

4.  Run make.

5.  Under UNIX run 'make install'.  Under DOS simply copy the resulting
    emagic.exe file to a directory in your PATH statement.

If you have any questions and/or comments contact the author at sg@mplik.ru
I would not mind getting a note from you if you simply find this program
useful.
